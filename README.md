# 🇮🇳 INDIAGO — Guardians of Time

A playable 3D educational adventure through Indian history, built for a hackathon demo (ages 9–15).
Zero build step — pure **Three.js (CDN) + vanilla JS modules**.

## ▶ Run it

Start the integrated frontend and backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

Then open **http://localhost:8080**. The Node backend serves the frontend and provides
`POST /api/history` for Kalam plus `GET /api/health` for a health check. Use Chrome/Edge
with internet (Three.js CDN).

## 🎮 Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| WASD / Arrows | Move (Shift = run) |
| Mouse-drag | Orbit camera · wheel = zoom |
| Space | Jump |
| E | Interact / Talk / Collect |
| I | Inventory |
| Esc | Pause |
| Touch | Left joystick + E / ⤒ / 🤖 / 🎒 buttons |

## 🔁 Core loop (every level)

Explore → find clues → talk to NPCs → collect artifacts → History Gate quiz (4/5 to pass, kind retry) →
final puzzle → Time Seal → portal → next era unlocked.

## 🗺️ Levels

1. **The Lost City** (Indus Valley) — 5 tablets, drainage-pipe puzzle
2. **The Scholar's Challenge** (Nalanda) — 5 scrolls, library shelving puzzle
3. **Rise of the Cholas** — 5 blueprint pieces, vimana stacking puzzle
4. **The Fort of Secrets** — 4 inscription shards, four trials

inventory, pause menu, results/victory screens, localStorage saves,
synthesized music/SFX (no assets), demo mode, and **Kalam 🤖** the history
guide with a RAG-ready `getHistoricalAnswer(question, context)` interface
(`js/kalam.js`) that works offline and accepts a future LLM endpoint.
